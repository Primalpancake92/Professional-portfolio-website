                            This project is a Command Line based program that runs on the terminal.
                            The objective of this project was to create a program that can calculate
                            and summarise statistical values of the performance of a classroom.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            What I did to program this, was use OOP to create student, teacher and 
                            class objects. Each class object would store different attributes and 
                            values that contained the teachers and students assigned to a classroom.
                            By interacting with the program, via the terminal, you add students and 
                            teachers to a classroom to calculate the overall performance (marks and 
                            grades) of the classroom.

                            This is the a library management system that mangaes the books that are
                            available in the library's inventory, store what is borrowed, what is 
                            returned, and who is borrowing it. It is a program that runs on the 
                            terminal.
