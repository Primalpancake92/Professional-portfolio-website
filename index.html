            <p>
                I am a highly disciplined and motivated student that is currently undertaking a Google cybersecurity course,
                starting content creation, and learning how to develop my own website to be a freelancer in website design
                and development. I am very familiar with Java and Python, which are showcased by the two projects that I have 
                on my Github repository.

                <p>
                    I have a Bachelor of Medical Science (First Class Hons.) with my dissertation having a focus on neurodegeneration
                    and neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease. Its purpose is to assess the influence of a novel cannabinoid receptor 
                    agonist on dopamine neurons. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am currently studying a Bachelor of Computing Science and I am in my second year. I am highly motivated in learning
                    relavent industry skills, such as website development. I have developed this website through my self study of HTML-CSS
                    and JavaScript. Furthermore, I have taken my interest in the cybsecurity world in the form of a Google course on Coursera.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The current programming langauges that I have learned already are Java and Python, and have had a CLI based program 
                    published on GitHub. It essentially generated key performance statistics for a classroom of students in a semester.
                    It employs the OOP to collectively separate the students, teachers, and classrooms that are generated by the user 
                    (hopefully this is the teacher). The aim was to provide some help to teachers who need a simpler process of gathering
                    marks and calculating things all in one command.
