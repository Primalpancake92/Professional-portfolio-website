            <p>
                I am a highly disciplined and motivated student that is currently undertaking a Google cybersecurity course,
                starting content creation, and learning how to develop my own website to be a freelancer in website design
                and development. I am very familiar with Java and Python, which are showcased by the two projects that I have 
                on my Github repository.
