                        Hi there, I'm John. Some of you may know me as The Debug Life, but I have not always been 
                        involved in the tech/programming space. I previously graduated with a bachelor of Medical 
                        Science with Honours. I had a thesis that assessed the influence of a novel cannabinoid 
                        receptor agonist drug in Parkinson's disease modelled mice. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Before starting this journey of learning programming and studying computer Science, I was
                        working for the Medical Oncology Clinical Trials Unit at Westmead hospital. A few months 
                        in the job, I felt burnt out to some degree. One evening on way back home, I asked myself
                        a question "Am I going to do this for the rest of my life?" I told myself no. I soon 
                        realised that, emotional investment is the key to fulfilment and enjoyment in any job.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        At the time, everything that I worked for felt like it was a waste and I regretted not 
                        making these decisions earlier. It too me some time to process what I had realised before 
                        I took any action. But here in 2025, I have learned so much about programming and learning
                        new skills as I progress through my degree.

                        I am currently studying a computer science degree, undertaking a Google Cybersecurity course
                        , and learning how to design a website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

                        <br>
                        As a mature aged student, I found it quite difficult to make the decision to go back to 
                        studying in university. There were many challenges that I have encountered during my time
                        studying. I was learning new things and concepts, which changed my learning approaches. It
                        took me quite some time to learn, adjust and adapt to how a programmer would learn. The 
                        lesson that I learned in 2024 was applying concepts in projects and assessing your code.

                        My goal is to land a Cybersecurity analyst job in either defensive (blue team) or offensive 
                        (red team) security. However, an alternative is to land a web development role. I enjoyed
                        the process of making my own portfolio website, so I would like to make more websites as
                        I progress further into my career aspirations.

                        My secondary goals are to establish a personal brand through content creation and contribute
                        in a proactive manner to people who are in the same situation as I am, going through the same
                        struggles as I am. I want to help people understand programming and get better at it.
